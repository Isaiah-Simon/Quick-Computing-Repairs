	<p class="smallPad">For almost 7 years I have been fixing and building computers. When I was 12 I was hired by my Uncleâ€™s company to help him to fix and build computers he would need for his office. After that, my love for computers increased dramatically. </p>
	<p>I worked with him for only a short time, but found that in my free time I was doing more and more with computers. In my junior year of high school I enrolled in the Computer System Technology tech class at the Center for Technology, Essex. In that class we learned the ins-and-outs of computer for both building and repair. In the two years I was in the class, I was always one of the top students and one of only two who received their A+ certification.</p>
	<p>In addition to that class, I was also given an internship at the University of Vermont, where I have been for almost 4 years. Since my start, years ago, I have become one of the most knowledgeable and most senior lead techs in our employment.</p>
